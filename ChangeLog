        <rdar://5510700> Repro crash loading embedded Windows Media Player
        content

        Anders noticed that the older Windows Media Player plugin (npdsplay.dll)
        will crash if it receives its resource requests out of order, whereas we
        were immediately fulfilling untargeted, non-JavaScript requests and
        scheduling targeted or JavaScript resource requests. Implement his
        suggested fix, which is to schedule PluginRequests for all resource
        requests 

        * plugins/win/PluginViewWin.cpp:
        (WebCore::getString):
        (WebCore::PluginViewWin::performRequest): If this non-JavaScript request
        has no target, create a stream for it
        (WebCore::PluginViewWin::load): Schedule PluginRequests for all resource
        requests
